"""Round-lifecycle / round-start subsystem for :class:`GameState`.

Issue #1271 next-increment extraction (stacked on the state-serialization cut
:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_serialization.StateSerializationMixin`):
the **round-start / round-setup orchestration** cluster is pulled out of the
``game/state.py`` God-Object into this ``RoundLifecycleMixin``.

The cluster is the "kick off the game and set up each new round" half of the
class: the LOBBY→PLAYING start gate plus the full ``start_round`` orchestration
(song selection, playback dispatch, metadata build, round-state commit). It is
**behavior-preserving**: it carries the exact same methods that previously
lived on ``GameState``, so its public API and every caller / test are
unchanged.

* ``start_game`` — the LOBBY→PLAYING start gate: validates the phase and the
  minimum player count, then flips to PLAYING (#390 precursor). Called by the
  admin ``start_game`` WebSocket / view handlers.
* ``start_round`` — the round-start orchestrator (#390): pulls the next
  playable song from the :class:`PlaylistManager`, skips/retries songs with no
  provider URI (capped at ``MAX_SONG_RETRIES``), dispatches playback through
  the lazily-created :class:`MediaPlayerService` (classifying ``unavailable``
  storefront skips vs. systemic playback failures per #808 / #949), builds the
  round metadata, commits the round state, flips the lights and fires the
  round-start TTS announcements (#471 / #841 / #842). The single entry point
  every "advance to the next round" caller (``ws_handlers``, ``game_views``,
  ``GameService``) hits.
* ``_ensure_media_player_service`` — lazily constructs the
  :class:`MediaPlayerService` on the first round (and wires analytics for
  error recording, Story 19.1) so the service is only created once a media
  player is configured.
* ``_prepare_intro_round`` — thin pass-through to
  ``RoundManager.prepare_intro_round`` (intro-splash deferral decision).
* ``_build_round_metadata`` — thin pass-through to
  ``RoundManager.build_round_metadata`` (initial wire-metadata dict, wiring the
  async metadata fetch coroutine).
* ``_initialize_round`` — commits all round state via
  ``RoundManager.initialize_round`` (timer/deadline, challenge setup, per-player
  round reset), clears ``round_analytics`` and flips to PLAYING through the
  single ``_set_phase`` chokepoint.

Why the cut stops here: the round-*end* path stays on ``GameState``. The shared
``_score_all_players`` loop and ``_end_round_unlocked`` are bound to the
vote-window / scoring coupling and are deliberately NOT moved (see
:class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_scoring.RoundScoringMixin`). The
REVEAL transition / auto-advance / reveal-lights helpers
(``_transition_to_reveal``, ``_schedule_reveal_advance``,
``_apply_reveal_lights``) also stay on ``GameState`` — they couple to the TTS,
vote-window and party-lights subsystems. The pause/resume + early-reveal +
``advance_to_end`` terminal helpers stay too; this cut is strictly the forward
round-*start* path.

The mixin relies on attributes / methods the host class owns and that live on
``self`` at runtime:

* ``self.phase`` / ``self._set_phase`` — phase read + the single transition
  chokepoint used by ``start_game`` / ``start_round`` / ``_initialize_round``.
* ``self.players`` — minimum-player-count gate (``start_game``) and the
  per-player round reset list passed to ``RoundManager.initialize_round``.
* ``self._playlist_manager`` — next-song selection, remaining-count
  (``last_round``) and ``mark_played`` for skipped songs.
* ``self.provider`` / ``self.storefront`` / ``self.platform`` /
  ``self.media_player`` — URI resolution and media-player dispatch context.
* ``self._media_player_service`` / ``self._stats_service`` — lazily-built
  playback service + the analytics sink wired into it.
* ``self._round_manager`` — the :class:`RoundManager` the intro/metadata/commit
  helpers delegate to; also supplies ``_timer_countdown`` / ``_on_round_end``
  callbacks.
* ``self._timer_countdown`` / ``self._on_round_end`` / ``self._fetch_metadata_async``
  — round-end + metadata-fetch callbacks/coroutines wired into ``RoundManager``;
  all stay on ``GameState`` (REVEAL coupling) and are referenced via ``self``.
* ``self._tts_service`` / ``self._tts_pre_round_delay`` — the #1211 pre-round
  TTS deadline shift.
* ``self._cancel_auto_advance`` — supersedes a pending REVEAL auto-advance on a
  new round start (#1012); stays on ``GameState``.
* ``self._lights_set_phase`` — party-light phase sync (owned by
  :class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_media.MediaControlMixin`).
* ``self.announce_round_start`` / ``self.announce_countdown`` /
  ``self.announce_last_round`` / ``self.announce_intro_round`` — round-start TTS
  announcements (owned by
  :class:`~custom_components.beatify.game.state_tts.TtsAnnouncerMixin`).
* ``self.deadline`` / ``self.round`` / ``self.current_song`` /
  ``self.last_round`` / ``self.round_analytics`` / ``self.is_intro_round`` /
  ``self.total_rounds`` / ``self.last_error_detail`` / ``self._now`` — round
  state read/written across the orchestration.

It carries no state of its own. ``GamePhase`` is imported lazily inside the
methods that need it (``# noqa: PLC0415``) to avoid a top-level circular import
back into ``state.py``; ``MediaPlayerService`` is likewise imported lazily
inside ``_ensure_media_player_service`` (matching the original).
