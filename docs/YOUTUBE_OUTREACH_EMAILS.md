# YouTube Outreach Emails for Beatify

## The Hook

**Beatify is the first game ever built for Home Assistant.**

Not another sensor integration. Not another automation helper. An actual multiplayer party game — running entirely on HACS. This has never been done before.

## Template 1: Everything Smart Home / Smart Home Solver (Large Channels)

**Subject:** The first game ever for Home Assistant — would you cover it?

---

Hi [Name],

I'm a fan of your Home Assistant content and wanted to share something different — **the first game ever built for Home Assistant.**

It's called **Beatify** — a multiplayer music trivia game that runs entirely through HACS. 

Not a sensor. Not an automation. An actual party game with points, streaks, power-ups, and a winner's podium — all running locally on Home Assistant.

**How it works:**
- Song plays through your speakers
- Guests scan a QR code (no app, no account)
- Everyone races to guess the release year
- Real-time scoring, confetti, and competition

**Why this is different:**
In 10+ years of Home Assistant, there's been nothing like this. HACS has 2,000+ integrations for controlling things — but zero for *playing* with your smart home. Beatify changes that.

**The details:**
- Works with Sonos, Music Assistant, Alexa speakers
- Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music support
- 780+ songs included
- Runs 100% local — no cloud, no subscription
- Tested with 20+ concurrent players

I think this could make for unique content — it's a first for the platform, and it shows Home Assistant can be fun, not just functional.

Happy to provide demo footage, answer questions, or walk through a setup.

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/mholzi/beatify
- Demo video: [attach or link]

Thanks for all your great content!

**Subject:** I built the first game ever for HACS — want a sneak peek?

Hey [Name],

Love your HA tutorials — they've helped me a ton.

I built something that's never existed before: **the first game for Home Assistant.**

It's called **Beatify** — a multiplayer music trivia party game that runs entirely on HACS. Not another integration for controlling things. An actual game, with scoring, competition, and a winner's podium.

**How it works:**
1. Host picks a speaker and playlist
2. Song plays, QR code appears
3. Guests scan (no app needed) and guess the year
4. Points, streaks, double-or-nothing bets
5. Podium finale with stats and confetti

In 10+ years of Home Assistant, there's never been anything like this. HACS has thousands of integrations — but zero games. Until now.

**The fun part:** My friends now demand "the music game" at every gathering. It's become the thing I show off instead of my automations.

**Technical highlights:**
- WebSocket real-time sync
- Music Assistant / Sonos / Alexa support
- Session persistence (reconnect if disconnected)
- Runs entirely local, 100% free

Would you be interested in checking it out? Happy to send a demo video or walk through setup.

Thanks for all your content!
